<h1>Blog API Project</h1>

In this website I've built my own API which contains the posts with their Id, Title, Content, Author and date, and connected it to my server using Axios.<br/>
One of the projects of Udemy's "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp".

<h2>Getting started :</h2>
- Open terminal.<br/>
- CD into the project folder.<br/>
- Run the index.js file using "nodemon".<br/>
- Open a new terminal and run server.js file on it.
