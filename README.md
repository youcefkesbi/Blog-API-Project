<h1>Blog API Project</h1>

In this website I've built my own API which contains the posts with their Id, Title, Content, Author and date, and connected it to my server using Axios
One of the projects of Udemy's "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp".

<h2>Getting started :</h2>
- Open terminal.
- CD into the project folder.
- Run the index.js file using "nodemon".
- Open a new terminal and run server.js file on it.
